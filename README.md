# LeetCode in C

This repository contains my solutions to selected LeetCode problems, implemented in **C** to demonstrate mastery of low-level algorithm design and memory-efficient programming.

Although I’m proficient in Python, I chose C for its performance and control over memory — making it ideal for practicing algorithmic thinking and system-level optimization.
